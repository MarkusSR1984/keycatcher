# keycatcher
JC3MP utility server package to capture key presses and call events.
Keys and corresponding events called are defined in config.json.
Events are called on client and server.

By default config.json contains a call to the servernews package on key 'n'.
This won't cause any issues unless you also want to use 'n'.
If you have the latest servernews package installed you will now be able to open/close it with 'n'.
